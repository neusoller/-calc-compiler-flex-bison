# 🖥️ Compiler-Based Calculator (Flex & Bison)  
This project implements a compiler-based calculator using Flex and Bison. It interprets arithmetic and boolean expressions, handles variable assignments, and supports mathematical functions such as sin, cos, tan, as well as predefined constants like π and e.

## 📌 Features  
✅ Supports integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans.  
✅ Lexical and syntactic analysis for complex expressions.  
✅ Variable assignments and evaluation of arithmetic & boolean expressions.  
✅ Predefined functions: **sin, cos, tan**, and constants **π, e**.  
✅ Support for multiple number representations: **Decimal, Octal, Binary, Hexadecimal**.  
✅ Detailed error handling (lexical, syntactic, and semantic).  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Flex & Bison** (Lexical & Syntactic Analysis)  
- **C Programming Language**
